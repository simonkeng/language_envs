# Language Envs

Each folder has a shell or `make` recipe to build and run containers for each language/purpose. The top level `Dockerfile` will build the `ubuenv` image that has everything. Currently I'm using VSCode and I will write code from the luxury of my colorful vim-keys IDE, but compile and execute from inside the linux containers (that I login to within the VSCode terminal), an all-in-one setup I've been enjoying lately. I often use `ubuenv` for non-development purposes such as profiling/tracing and system exploration.
